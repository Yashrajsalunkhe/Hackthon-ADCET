## 📝 Notes

1. **Component Enhancement**: Some components (like Judges/Speakers, Team, Sponsors) have simplified data arrays. You can easily add more entries by editing the respective component files.

2. **Original Styles**: All CSS from the original website is preserved in the `src/css/` folder.

3. **Assets**: All images, logos, and assets are in the `public/` folder and accessible.

4. **Fully Functional**: The website is ready to use, with all sections working as in the original HTML version.

## 🔧 Customization

To add more data to any section:
1. Open the component file in `src/components/`
2. Find the data array at the top
3. Add new entries following the existing pattern
4. The component will automatically render the new data

## 📖 Example: Adding a Team Member

```jsx
// In src/components/Team.jsx
const teamMembers = [
  // ... existing members
  { 
    name: 'New Member', 
    role: 'Role', 
    img: 'assets/Team/image.png', 
    linkedin: 'https://linkedin.com/...', 
    email: 'email@example.com' 
  },
];
```

## 🌟 Benefits of React Version

- **State Management**: Better data handling with React hooks
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM for faster updates
- **Maintainability**: Organized code structure
